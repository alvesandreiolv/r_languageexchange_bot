The purpose of this project is to create a bot for the r/LanguageExchange subreddit that automates some of the common tasks and improves user experience.

This project is a great way to learn about the Reddit API, natural language processing, and automation. It can also be a valuable tool for the r/LanguageExchange community, making the subreddit a better place for language learners to connect.
